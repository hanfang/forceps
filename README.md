marlin
==============

marlin is a tool for designing RNA antisense oligonucleotides. It is built with the Smithâ€“Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment, while allowing both Wobble pairing and Watson-Crick pairing. marlin reports the number of edit distance, mismatches, insertion, deletion, back to back ed, and ed near either end of the query sequence.

marlin report format:
chr	start	end	query	strand	edit_distance	mis_match	insertion	deletion	back_to_back	near_edge	Wooble

marlin is currently under development.
